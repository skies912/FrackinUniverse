Ranged and Melee weapons behave a little differently in FrackinUniverse. The most important changes are listed in this codex.

^orange;Crit Chance and Crit Damage^reset;
---------------------------
Weapon item tooltips have new icons. The two on the left represent Critical Chance bonus and Critical Damage bonus.

^orange;Ammo and Reload Speed^reset;
---------------------------
Ammo and Reload speed are represented by the right-side icons.


Items with a '--' representing a value in any of the above stats means it does not apply to them. This is the case with modded weapons, or energy-only (non-ammo) guns, primarily.

^blue;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^reset;
^green;Ranged^reset;

^orange;Ammo-Based Weapons^reset;
------------------
Some weapons now use ammunition. Don't worry, you won't need to carry resources around with you to refill them. These weapons simply use much, much less energy in exchange for the mobility boost provided by having extra energy! Note that their alt fires will always require energy, regardless of their primary fire.

You can reload these weapons manually by holding the SHIFT key and clicking the mouse button. Empty the magazine through shooting will also automatically engage the reload.


^blue;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^reset;
^green;Melee^reset;

^orange;Combos^reset;
---------------
Each strike of a combo, whether or not it hits a target, consumes 1% of your energy. Be warned, tactics involving stun-locking enemies are no longer as viable.
Many weapons with combos provide additional bonuses when striking with these combos.

^orange;Shield Bash^reset;
---------------
Blocking with shields on enemies has a chance to Shield Bash. Certain gear can increase the Shield Bash chances.  

Shield Bash can damage foes, and send them reeling backwards. When Perfect Blocking, there is a 50% chance to Stun foes that are successfully bashed. When not perfect blocking, be wary: There is a chance -you- will get stunned on a badly timed block.

^orange;Hammer^reset;
---------------
The longer you hold the charge of this melee weapon type, the higher your Critical and Stun chance get (to a maximum of ^green;100^reset;%).
A hammer charged above ^green;75^reset;% will inflict a massive bonus eruption capable of stunning and tossing foes around.
Over-Charging the hammer past ^green;100^reset;% will automatically cancel the bonus.

^orange;Great Axe^reset;
---------------
The longer you hold the charge of this melee weapon type, the higher your Critical Chance and Critical Damage get (to a maximum of ^green;100^reset;%).
A greataxe charged above ^green;75^reset;% will inflict a massive bonus eruption capable of bleeding and tossing foes around.
Over-Charging the greataxe past ^green;100^reset;% will automatically cancel the bonus.

^orange;Axe^reset;
---------------
Each consecutive kill made with an axe increases your maximum damage by +^green;1^reset;%, to a maximum of ^green;50^reset;%. 
If your health is reduced below ^red;20^reset;%, this bonus is cancelled.
Each consecutive hit in a row with an axe increases Crit Chance by +^green;3^reset;% (to a maximum of ^green;15^reset;%)

^orange;Dagger^reset;
---------------
Consecutive rapid kills temporarily increase damage 
+^green;25^reset;% Dodge Tech Efficiency
Combo Strikes increase Protection and Crit Chance with each strike. The protection bonus is greatest on First Strike, and reduces each hit thereafter.
