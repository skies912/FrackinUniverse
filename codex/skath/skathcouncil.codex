"The body politic of the Skath is referred to as 'The Council of Elders' and is exactly what it sounds like. The four eldest of their kind rule the entire species. It is the only such form of government known in the cosmos (for how can only four dictate the course of an entire species?) but has maintained power over the Skath Imperium for at least two to three hundred years.",
"To be considered for the council, a Skath must first reach the age of Last Nest (somewhere around sixty in human years) and have no less than three hundred offspring. His role in the military must have been a major one, with a rank no less than Admiral. Finally, they must have seen combat at least twice (heroics and long-standing combat records are preferred.)",
"The first council is said to have been voted upon by the people, but all documentation of that era has been long since lost. Personally, I find it hard to believe that an entire species agreed that absolute power over all should rest on the shoulders of their Elders. The logistics of that are frightening, to say the least. The reality is worse."
