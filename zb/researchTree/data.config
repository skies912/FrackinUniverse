Clicking on a research on the displayed list will center the view on it. Click on the button again to hide the list.\n- The third button will center the view on the middle of the tree, or the currently selected research.\n- The last button toggles ^orange;low quality mode^reset;, which will make the GUI jump to a position instead of panning to it via the search list, or the center button. In addition, dragging/navigating on the the main screen will update only after you release the mouse button. It is best to use the search list with this mode enabled." ],
