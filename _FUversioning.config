______________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.430^reset;

  * base Production of items for bees has been reduced by 50%
  * all bee values for Breed Rates and Production have been tweaked to give more importance to breeding, and to rebalance around the new production rates. This also serves to make bees production when absent more desirable.

  -- Misc --
  * Aen Wood furniture added (PixelFlame)

______________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.427^reset;

  -- Coming Soon --
  ^green;Research System / Progression Overhaul^reset;

  -- Biomes --
  * Aether Seas are now Aetheric Worlds, and feature a land-based variant (Pixelflame)

  -- Misc --
  * Vork the Penguin's shop lets you sequence break progression a little too hard. Instead of selling useful things like gasses, mech parts, crystals and silicon, he now sells junk ship parts which you can use to cheaply create a larger BYOS ship earlier in the game than you would otherwise. (anoobindisguise)
  * The starting BYOS ship is now made of junk (rusty sloped panels replace the ship's hull, while the inside is replaced with rusty metal latticed by scrap panels. (anoobindisguise)
  * Completing the 'build a Small FTL Drive' quest now gives you clean sloped hull panels, wall panels, ship supports and metal railings (thus giving you the blueprints) so that you can build a clean, shiny BYOS ship if you put the effort in. (anoobindisguise)
  * Maces have more possible RNG outcomes now, thanks to PandorasBox additions
  * Insta-Freud machines received an updgrade to their madness-reduction capabilities
  * added Pyreite rifle (anoobindisguise)
  * Armor with combined augments installed on it will no longer be upgradeable, which should cease InstructionLimit errors for careless players using over-abused combined augments. (Kherae)
  * Fuel Efficiency is now labelled as Fuel Cost Reduction (Kherae)
  * Crew Fuel Cost Reductions rebalanced. Highest is now 20%, while most are 10 or under (Kherae)
  * Madness will now inform you when you are carrying goods that can increase your Madness
  * updated vehicle ban object script (Kherae)
  * readded raceeffectenabler image, which techs have been using for their icon (Kherae)
  * updated power code to -hopefully- catch excessive recursion cases, via an iteration threshold that is checked. threshold may need lowering later. (Kherae)
  * debug code in vanilla's /scripts/actions/dialog.lua, to find which npcs have missing dialog data (and hopefully address npcs exploding in any situation from any mod) (Kherae)
  * sanity checks in techconsole and antidote patches. (Kherae)
  * moved 'mad' effect to the 'madnessstuffindicator' folder (Kherae)
  * moved khe breadcrum quests to khe_tasks (Kherae)

  -- Bugs --
  * Implemented a fix to vanilla's /quests/scripts/main.lua. fix addresses an issue with rewards being obtainable before the quest is actually accepted. Unfortunately, part of the fix involves a persistent 'quest started' variable being set when the quest is actually started. in order to keep things smooth (and prevent further exploits), in the cases of older quests without the variable the script will auto-abandon quests that can be abandoned, or re-run quest start function for non-abandonable quests once per quest, on first update after init. (Kherae) 
  * Add missing name of Toxic Kelp sapling (edwardspec)
  * fixed a derp with effectUtil causing stunlock
  * fixed capturegun rework adjustments
  * fixed a weird output bug on Arc and Blast furnaces (Kherae)
  * fixed Flesh Lamp (Kherae)
  * Removed secondary research entries in the Atmos. Condensers (Kukagres)
  * corrections to punctuation on Honey Jars (Kukagres)
  * fixed a sneaky race condition in item transfer code. (Kherae)
  * the tacky crown's mask was changed, so now duncettes can keep their hair (and ears where applicable). (Kherae)
  * added indicators for when you are carrying weird stuff. (Kherae)
  * unless a weapon explicitly supports the ammo system it should no longer apply stats from it, to prevent issues with other mods' weapons. (Kherae)
  * fixed a bad asset path in moonstone magnorbs (Kherae)
  * fixed mismatched frames files in an aether console (Kherae)
  * copied firerocketcharge.png as hellfirerocketcharge.png to address missing image errors (Kherae)
